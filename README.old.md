a) Description:
ParkPass is a full-stack application that allows a user to search through a database of national parks and save them. When saved, a park will be added to a user’s page and displayed as a card. Users can then check off if they’ve hiked at the selected park and add a review of their experience, which can be created, edited, and deleted. 


b) Brief Example:

Click any of the navigation buttons on the app to find a list of parks, or sign up to create your own list of parks you’ve already visited.
